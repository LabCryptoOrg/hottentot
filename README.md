# Hottentot RPC Framework
### About Hottentot
Hottentot is a RPC Framework. It allows developers to focus on their business on client and server sides. Hottentot is light weight and it does not need any additional dependency to get compiled and work. Currently, it generates source files for C++ and Java. Other languages will be added soon. See Examples section for going through a quick guide.

### Installation
#### Linux
Download or clone the source code from Github. Just run `make` and `make install` in order to compile and install Hottentot.

```shell
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
 $ hot
```

#### Windows

Support for Windows exists. We will add documentation so soon.
